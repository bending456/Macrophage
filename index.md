# Introduction
The 'macrophage pathway analysis' suite provides a workflow for 
- curating a signal transduction pathway network describing transmember receptor (TM)-dependent activation of gene regulation
- performing 'shortest path' analyses that link transmembrane receptors to gene up/down regulation



## Required Software
- [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/): Provide a great graphic support along with the large database of pathways (Signor, Wikipathway, etc.) 
- [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb): Cloud-based iPython Notebook provided by Google
- Python: For the beginner, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) should be useful and informative. You can register yourself with Google account.

## This tutorial will cover ... 
- Visualization and curation of a signal transduction network 
- Pathway analyses for a signal transduction network
- Advanced topics including
-- Input files and their structure 
-- How to upload files
-- Calculation details
